Automated Excel Report Generator using Python | Styling, Merging & Analysis

This project is a demo version of an automated Excel reporting tool developed using Python, Pandas, and OpenPyXL. It showcases how multiple datasets—such as sales and operations data—can be merged, processed, and formatted into a daily professional Excel report. The styling includes color-coded columns, header formatting, and number formatting for better readability. While the logic is inspired by real-world reporting tasks I handled in a professional setting, all the data used here is fictional and created solely for demonstration purposes. This project highlights my ability to streamline manual reporting processes through automation.

#Features
- Merges multiple DataFrames for combined insights
- Highlights columns with suffixes like `_Profit` (pink) and `_UsedResources` (blue)
- Applies formatting (fonts, alignment, borders, number formats)
- Auto-exports final report as `Analysis_Report_<date>.xlsx`

#Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- openpyxl
- Excel automation

#How to Run
1. Place your datasets in the appropriate folder.(or update the path of files)
2. Run the script: `Automated_Sales & Resource Report.ipynb` 
3. The final styled Excel report will be generated in the `/DEMO` folder.(Whatever location you will choose)

#Purpose
This project is designed for business analysts or data teams looking to automate repetitive reporting tasks and produce professional, formatted Excel outputs without manual effort.

#About the Data
The data used in this project is DEMO DATA and does not contain any real or sensitive information. The structure and logic were inspired by real-world reporting tasks I performed in a professional setting.
